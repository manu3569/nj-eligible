              <h4>Loans from a CDFI</h4>
              <p>
                Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) play a critical role in
                providing access to financing tools and resources to businesses and individuals
                that have difficulty accessing the traditional banking sector. Specifically,
                the NJEDA has created two programs
                (<a href="https://faq.business.nj.gov/en/articles/3835240" target="_blank">https://faq.business.nj.gov/en/articles/3835240</a>),
                the <strong>CDFI Emergency Assistance Grant Program</strong>
                and the <strong>CDFI Loan Loss Reserve Fund</strong> to help local CDFI’s scale their lending
                to micro and small businesses, especially in communities and business segments
                that are traditionally underserved.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can reach out directly to a CDFI to see if you would be eligible for any
                of their State-supported and non-State supported financing programs.  Click the
                link above to see a list of New Jersey-based CDFIs that focus on micro and small
                business financing.

              <h4>Financing from a private bank</h4>
              <p>
                Often one of the most reliable sources of financing for micro, small, and medium-sized
                businesses is their traditional business banking partner.  Many banks in New Jersey work
                with the NJEDA to provide low cost financing to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
                You can contact your local banking branch for more information.
