                How many W-2 full time equivalent (FTE) employees does
                your business have?

                Please include yourself as one employee.

                If you have part time employees, for each part-time W-2 employee
                estimate the number of hours worked per week, divide that number
                by 35 and that is the factional FTE estimate for that employee.

                Sum all fractional FTEs for part-time W-2 employees and add that
                to 1 FTE for each full-time employee.

                Do not include 1099 employees in this calculation
