            Can I learn more about the Small Business Emergency Assistance Guarantee Program?
          </h2>

          <p>
            The Small Business Emergency Assistance Program is a $10 million pilot program
            that makes available one-year first loss guarantees of permanent working capital
            loans and lines of credit originated by Premier Lender banks and Premier Community
            Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs).  These loans must be made to cover
            operating expenses for New Jersey small businesses and non-profit organizations
            that have been impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.
          </p>

          <p>
            The program provides a 50% guarantee, not to exceed a total NJEDA exposure of
            $100,000 to Premier Lenders or Premier CDFIs that will issue working capital loans
            or lines of credit to support business continuity for a range of COVID-19 related
            impacts to businesses (reduced revenue, employee shortage, supply chain impact, etc.)
            There are no NJEDA fees associated with applying for this program.
          </p>
